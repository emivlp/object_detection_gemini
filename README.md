# **Object Detection with Gemini API**

## **Leveraging AI for Open-Vocabulary Detection, Attribute Recognition, and Scene Understanding**

### **Introduction**

Object detection is a fundamental task in **computer vision**, enabling AI models to **identify and localize objects** within an image. This notebook demonstrates **how to use the Gemini API for object detection**, including:

ðŸ”¹ **Single & Multi-Class Object Detection**

ðŸ”¹ **Attribute-Based Recognition (e.g., Detecting red umbrellas, white dresses)**

ðŸ”¹ **Negative Object Detection (Ensuring absent objects are not falsely identified)**

ðŸ”¹ **World Knowledge for Object Identification (e.g., Recognizing Dog Breeds)**

ðŸ”¹ **Reading Handwritten Text & Detecting Objects Referenced in Text**

ðŸ”¹ **Spatial Reasoning & Scene Understanding**

This work showcases **how Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can analyze, reason, and interact** with images using advanced AI techniques.
